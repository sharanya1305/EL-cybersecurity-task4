Prepared by: Jitta Sharanya
Date: 2026-01-21

1. Password Storage Basics
• Hashing: One-way irreversible transformation of a password.
• Encryption: Reversible transformation of data using keys.
• Common hash types: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, bcrypt.

2. Attacking Weak Passwords
• Dictionary attack: Tries passwords from a predefined list.
• Brute force: Tries every possible combination.
• Weak passwords fail due to predictability and low entropy.

3. Tools Used
• Hashcat: GPU-accelerated password cracking tool.
• John the Ripper: Efficient CPU-based cracking tool.
• Online Hash Identifiers: Detects hash format.

4. Authentication Improvements
• Enable MFA for added security.
• Use strong passwords: 12+ chars, mix of symbols, no dictionary words.
• Avoid reuse across sites.
